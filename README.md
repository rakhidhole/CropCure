# CropCure
🌾Crop diseases cause major losses for farmers, especially in rural areas where access to expert help is limited. This project, CropCure, is a web-based system that uses deep learning to detect plant diseases from leaf images. Built with Django and CNN, it provides quick disease identification, symptoms, and treatment tips. With multilingual support and a simple interface, CropCure empowers farmers to protect their crops, reduce losses, and promote smart, sustainable farming.
## 🚀 Features

- 🖼️ Image Upload: Upload plant leaf images
- 🤖 CNN Model Integration: Predict diseases using a trained deep learning model
- 💾 User History: Saves prediction history per user using Django ORM
- 🌍 Multilingual Support: Integrated Google Translate for multi-language user experience
- 🔐 User Authentication: Sign-up, login, and user-specific data
- 🧠 Disease Knowledge Base: Displays disease symptoms,treatment,sample images
